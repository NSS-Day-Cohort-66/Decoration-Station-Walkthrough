# Item Edit
In these sessions we have been building an Edit form for the user to edit one of their decorations. When the user is viewing the details of an item an edit button will be displayed under the details. If the user clicks the button, it will take them to _localhost:3000/items/[item id]/edit_ where a form, populated with the current values of the item, will appear.
