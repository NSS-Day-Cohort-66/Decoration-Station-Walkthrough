# Introducing components and props
In this session of the Decoration Station workshop, we talked about rendering components and passing props to components. In `App.js` we took out all the JSX code that mapped and displayed our items and made it its own component called `ItemsList`. We rendered the `ItemsList` component in our `App` component and passed the necessary state as props. We talked about how each component has a props object and we can add key/value pairs to that object when we render the component. We looked at the key/value pairs in the react devtools and talked about destructuring the props object.
