# Routing
In these sessions of the Decoration Station workshop, we have begun to introduce Routing. We defined some routes in our `App` component that will render our other components depending on the url. We talked about child/parent routes, `index` routes, and the `Outlet` component. In the second session we created a `NavBar` component so that the user can navigate to the Decoration Form View and back to the home of the application where they can see all the items. We did this by using the `Link` component from *React-Router-Dom*. We also added the functionality to navigate back to the home view with all the items after the user successfully creates a new decoration. We did this by utilizing the `useNavigate` hook from *React-Router-Dom*. After the user clicks *Add Decoration* in the decoration form, the app will navigate back to the home of the app, displaying all the items where the user can see the new item they posted.
